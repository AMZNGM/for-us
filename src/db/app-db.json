He finishes it and then pours another cup, and so on, without disturbing the order. ✋🏻 But if you want to stop drinking at any time, say 'thank you' (either while the cup is being passed to you or after you've had one cup), which means you're satisfied. Don't say 'I don't want any more' or 'No, thanks'. 😅 It's a fun fact, and my friends and I laugh a lot because I'm so used to saying 'thank you' for everything. Every time someone offers me a cup of mate, I say 'thank you,' not because I don't want to continue, but because I like to express my gratitude that they took the time to pour it and serve it to me. 🙊 Some people have stopped giving it to me, and I'm embarrassed to say that I want to keep drinking.",
